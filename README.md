# indexed-linked-list

A data structure that combines the power of arrays and linked lists. Implemented in LISP, using Emacs's ORG mode

## First Note

I know this is not a very popular language but I am developing a research in which I am using it. The need for a
data structure like this in this language motivated me to implement an _indexed-linked-list_. If you need
this data structure in your no-LISP project you can read the org file and implement the structure by yourself
using the same idea. Please just mention me in case this project have been helpful.

## Setting Up the environment

Once in this directory create a folder with name ```src```. Then open ```indexed-linked-list.org``` file with Emacs.
Type ```M-x``` and then ```org-babel-tangle```. Then you will have the required .lisp file to use the data structure,
along with a test file that you can ignore.

## Documentation

Org files are documentation by themselves. For example, you can export them to pdf or html.
Any doubt about the data structure use and implementation can be found in the org file.

Any contribution and issue report will be very appreciated!
